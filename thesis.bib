It thus avoids local methods, for example, and presents proofs in a way that highlights the important parts of the arguments. Readers are assumed to be able to fill in the details, which in many places are left as exercises.},

	abstract = {In 1849, Dirichlet [5] proved that the probability that two positive integers are relatively prime is 1/ζ(2). Later, it was generalized into the case that positive integers have no nontrivial kth power common divisor. In this paper, we further generalize this result: the probability that the gcd of m products of n positive integers is B-friable is ∏p{\textgreater}B[1−\{1−(1−1p)n\}m] for m≥2. We show that it is lower bounded by 1ζ(s) for some s{\textgreater}1 if B{\textgreater}nmm−1, which completes the heuristic proof in the cryptanalysis of cryptographic multilinear maps by Cheon et al. [2]. We extend this result to the case of k-gcd: the probability is ∏p{\textgreater}B[1−\{1−(1−1p)n(1+H1np+⋅⋅⋅+Hk−1npk−1)\}m], where Hin=(n+i−1i).},

	abstract = {From the review: "The present book has as its aim to resolve a discrepancy in the textbook literature and ... to provide a comprehensive introduction to algebraic number theory which is largely based on the modern, unifying conception of (one-dimensional) arithmetic algebraic geometry. ... Despite this exacting program, the book remains an introduction to algebraic number theory for the beginner... The author discusses the classical concepts from the viewpoint of Arakelov theory.... The treatment of class field theory is ... particularly rich in illustrating complements, hints for further study, and concrete examples.... The concluding chapter {VII} on zeta-functions and L-series is another outstanding advantage of the present textbook.... The book is, without any doubt, the most up-to-date, systematic, and theoretically comprehensive textbook on algebraic number field theory available." W.

	abstract = {In mathematics, a composition of an integer n is a way of writing n as the sum of a sequence of (strictly) positive integers. Two sequences that differ in the order of their terms define different compositions of their sum, while they are considered to define the same partition of that number. Every integer has finitely many distinct compositions. Negative numbers do not have any compositions, but 0 has one composition, the empty sequence. Each positive integer n has 2n−1 distinct compositions.

A weak composition of an integer n is similar to a composition of n, but allowing terms of the sequence to be zero: it is a way of writing n as the sum of a sequence of non-negative integers. As a consequence every positive integer admits infinitely many weak compositions (if their length is not bounded). Adding a number of terms 0 to the end of a weak composition is usually not considered to define a different weak composition; in other words, weak compositions are assumed to be implicitly extended indefinitely by terms 0.
To further generalize, an  A-restricted composition of an integer n, for a subset A of the (nonnegative or positive) integers, is an ordered collection of one or more elements in A whose sum is n.},
